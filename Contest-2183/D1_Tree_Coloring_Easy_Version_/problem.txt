This is the Easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you are only required to find the minimum number of operations. You can hack only if you solved all versions of this problem. 

You are given a rooted tree^{\text{∗}} consisting of n vertices numbered from 1 to n, where the root has index 1, and each vertex is initially white. Define d_i as the distance from the root to the i-th vertex. You can perform the following operations any number of times: 

  Select a subset S of white vertices such that no two nodes in S are connected by an edge, or have the same distance to node 1. Formally, S should satisfy for all x,y\in S and x\neq y, d_x\neq d_y and there are no edges between x and y.

 Color the vertices in S black. 

 Your job is to find the minimum number of operations required to color the full tree black.^{\text{∗}}A tree is a connected graph without cycles.  A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex is special and called the root. 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5) – the number of vertices in the tree.

The i-th following n-1 lines contain two integers u_i and v_i (1\le u_i,v_i\le n, u_i\neq v_i) – the ends of the i-th edge.

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2\cdot10^5.

Output:
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations on a new line.

Note:
In the first test case, d_1=1 and d_2=d_3=d_4=d_5=2. We can show that we must perform at least 5 operations because there are no two nodes that can be operated on simultaneously.

In the second test case, we can show that the least number of operations required to color the full tree is 4. One way to do so is to color nodes 1 and 3 in the same operation, and all 3 other nodes in their own operations.
