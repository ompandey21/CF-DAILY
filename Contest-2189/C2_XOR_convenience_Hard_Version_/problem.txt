This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, 1 \le i \le n-1. 

Note:
that a correct solution for the hard version is not necessarily a correct solution for the easy version.

Given a positive integer n. Find some permutation^{\text{∗}} p of length n such that for every i (\style{color:red}{1 \le i \le n-1}) there exists j (\style{color:red}{i \le j \le n}) such that p_i = p_j \oplus i^{\text{†}}, or determine that it does not exist.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).^{\text{†}}\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The only line of each test case contains one positive integer n (3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, if there is a suitable permutation, output n integers p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n — the permutation p. Otherwise, output -1.

If multiple solutions exist, output any of them.

Example:
Input:
2

3

4

Output:
2 1 3
-1

Note:
In the first test case, the permutation p = [2,1,3] fulfills the condition, as p_2 = 1 and p_3 \oplus 2 = 1$$$.

In the second test case, there is no suitable permutation.
