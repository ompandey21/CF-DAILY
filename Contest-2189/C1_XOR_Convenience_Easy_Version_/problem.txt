This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, 2 \le i \le n-1. 

Note:
that a correct solution for the hard version is not necessarily a correct solution for the easy version.

Given a natural number n. Find a permutation^{\text{∗}} p of length n, such that for each i (\style{color:red}{2 \le i \le n-1}) there exists a j (\style{color:red}{i \le j \le n}) such that p_i = p_j \oplus i^{\text{†}}.

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, there exists at least one suitable permutation p.^{\text{∗}}A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).^{\text{†}}\oplus denotes the bitwise XOR operation. 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) — the length of the permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, output n integers p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n — the permutation p.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

Example:
Input:
2

3

6

Output:
2 1 3
3 6 2 5 1 4

Note:
In the first test case, the permutation p = [2,1,3] is suitable since p_2 = 1 and p_3 \oplus 2 = 1.

In the second test case, the permutation p = [3,6,2,5,1,4] is suitable, as:

  p_2 = 6 = 4 \oplus 2 = p_6 \oplus 2 

 p_3 = 2 = 1 \oplus 3 = p_5 \oplus 3 

 p_4 = 5 = 1 \oplus 4 = p_5 \oplus 4 

 p_5 = 1 = 4 \oplus 5 = p_6 \oplus 5$$$
