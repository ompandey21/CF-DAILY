This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is that in this version, you only need to evaluate for whole string s, s is regular, and the constraints on n are higher.

We say that a bracket sequence a is better than a bracket sequence b if one of the following holds: 

  b is a prefix of a, but a \ne b; or 

 let i be the first position (if it exists) where a_i \neq b_i, then \color{red}{a_i = \texttt{(}} and \color{red}{b_i = \texttt{)}}. 

You are given a regular bracket sequence^{\text{∗}} s of even length n.

Among all non-empty subsequences^{\text{†}} t of s that are regular bracket sequences, find the maximum possible length of t such that t is better than s. If no such t exists, report it.^{\text{∗}}A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting the characters \texttt{1} and \texttt{+} between the original characters of the sequence. For example:

  bracket sequences \texttt{()()} and \texttt{(())} are regular (the resulting expressions are \texttt{(1)+(1)} and \texttt{((1+1)+1)}); 

 bracket sequences \texttt{)(}, \texttt{(}, and \texttt{)} are not.^{\text{†}}A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions. 

Input:
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4). The description of the test cases follows. 

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5, n is even) — the length of the string s.

The second line of each test case contains a sequence s of length n consisting only of characters \texttt{(} and \texttt{)}.

It is guaranteed that the given sequence s is a regular bracket sequence.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.

Output:
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum possible length of a non-empty subsequence t of s that is a regular bracket sequence and is better than s. If no such t exists, print -1.

Example:
Input:
3

2

()

8

(()(()))

6

(())()

Output:
-1

6

-1

Note:
In the first example, the only non-empty regular bracket subsequence of s is t = s = \texttt{()}. Since t is not better than s, we output -1.

In the second example, we can choose t = \texttt{((()))}. The first index where t and s differ is i = 3. Since t_3 = \texttt{(} and s_3 = \texttt{)}, t is better than s. We cannot choose a longer subsequence because the only longer regular bracket subsequence is s itself, which is not better than s. Thus, we output 6.
